= Introduction =

The wavelogger is intended to be deployed into the rocky intertidal to measure water velocity data.

= Batteries = 

The wavelogger is designed to run with two AA sized 3.7v Lithium batteries.  Tadiran TL-5104's are what we use.

= SDCards =

The SDCard can have a large impact on the battery life of the wevelogger.  Check out [SDCardMeasurement] for a discussion of the relevant factors.  We have found that the current SanDisk 2GB cards are excellent.

The [SDCardSetup] page describes how to correctly configure an SDCard for use in the wavelogger.
