#summary How to troubleshoot the Wavelogger

= Introduction =

There are two ways to debug a problem with the Wavelogger.  The first is to note the sequence of LED's that are flashing over and over again.  The table of LED flashes and possible problems is below.

The second is to restart the Wavelogger with the USB disc attached.  Then when the failure happens you can hit return a couple times in CuteCom or whatever serial console you are using and in a few seconds the Wavelogger will print out an error stack that can be used as a guide through the source code.  You can also use the shell at that point to view the contents of the file system and test individual pieces of the hardware.
