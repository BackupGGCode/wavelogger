-Check that the files in the cpp_files, asm_files... are actually *.cpp and *.asm.

-Check that there is at least one source file.

-Cleanup product_type plugins.

-Make general structured variable validator.

        The product type is already set up as a plug-in module of sorts in
the build system.  The actions are hard coded right now with build being
the default and clean being a kludge.  It doesn't take into account the
product type.  Which causes a problem for me when I try to clean a product
of type "subdirectories" because it doesn't recurse.

        One thought I had was to make a separate plug-in for each feature.
But some of the features are better expressed in combinations.  And some,
like the actions are best expressed as methods on the product type/tool
chain/platform combos.

        So perhaps the correct way to deal with this is to have product
type plug-ins and tool plug-ins.  The tool plug-ins would export tables of
valid (tool chain, platform, processor) triplets.  The product type
plug-ins would have a method to determine which actions they support and a
method to perform a given action.

        The flavors should probably be options to the product type
plug-ins.

              product                  tool
              type                     chain
                |                        |
                V                        V
          +-----------+             +----------+
product-->|           |  platform-->|          |
flavor--->|           | processor-->|          |
action--->|           |<----------->|          |
          +-----------+             +----------+
